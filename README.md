# DND Management

## Why
I created this project as a way to teach myself web development with React.
After starting my first actual DND campaign (as opposed to playing hours of BG3 by myself),
I quickly realized I need a way to track my resources, character info, and notes about the campaign.
Instead of finding one of the many existing tools out there, I decided it's the perfect excuse to learn React and dabble in more front-end work which is a nice change of pace for me.

## Features
* Home page with an overview of my character
* Stats page with my character's base stats and abilities
* Tracker page with changeable inputs to help track changes in HP, uses of spell slots and limited abilities, etc.
* Details page with the full descriptions of any of my character's abilities for reference

## Future
* Back the app with a database so that updated tracker info can actually be saved and loaded from session to session
* Add a notes page for important notes taken during sessions. TBD whether I want a page to actually take notes on vs. writing them in Google docs and uploading to my database for cleaner display later.

## Technology
* TypeScript
* React/HTML/CSS
